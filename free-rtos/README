This directory contains a port of FreeRTOS for AVR ATMega2560, intended to be compiled using a Linux/GCC toolchain.
Enough is included to build the demo (see `Demo/AVR_ATMega2560_GCC/build.sh`).
Demos and ports for other platforms have been removed to avoid confusion.

This was used for testing QEMU AVR emulation, you'll find that the demo's EEPROM support has been disabled for this purpose.
AVR support may or may not have made it into QEMU by the time anyone reads this!
(If using this for verification, apply the LED patch and look for the right-most LED flashing; it's used by the Demo to indicate all tests ok)

Files of interest:
- qemu-leds.patch (diff that can be applied to QEMU to add a hacky GPIO peripheral that displays LED states as ASCII)
- Source/portable/GCC/ATMega2560/ (contains 2560 port)
- Demo/AVR_ATMega2560_GCC/ (contains 2560 demo)
- Demo/AVR_ATMega2560_GCC/demo.elf (pre-built demo binary)
- Demo/AVR_ATMega2560_GCC/build.sh (script to build demo, requires avr-gcc)
- Demo/AVR_ATMega2560_GCC/run.sh (script to run demo under QEMU, includes USART loopback via a FIFO, requires netcat)


Original readme follows:

Directories:

+ The FreeRTOS/Source directory contains the FreeRTOS source code, and contains
  its own readme file.

+ The FreeRTOS/Demo directory contains a demo application for every official
FreeRTOS port, and contains its own readme file.

+ See http://www.freertos.org/a00017.html for full details of the directory 
  structure and information on locating the files you require.

The easiest way to use FreeRTOS is to start with one of the pre-configured demo 
application projects (found in the FreeRTOS/Demo directory).  That way you will
have the correct FreeRTOS source files included, and the correct include paths
configured.  Once a demo application is building and executing you can remove
the demo application file, and start to add in your own application source
files.
