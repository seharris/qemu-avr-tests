This set of test programs is designed to exercise as much of the AVR instruction set as possible.
It was built to compare QEMU's emulation to the behaviour of hardware.


# Dependencies

- `bash` and the standard GNU shell utilities are needed for processing files
- `avr-gcc` is needed to assemble generated programs into binaries
- `avr-gdb` is needed to monitor execution under QEMU


# Build process.

Run `build.sh` to (re)generate and compile the assembly code for every test program.

Test programs are generated from templates, most of which work with several different instructions.
`build.sh` includes a table that maps test templates to the instructions they should be applied to.
Each test template is implemented by a Bash script in `src/`, which will take the name of one instruction and generate assembly code to standard output.

Generated assembly code from each test is stored in correspondingly named files in `generated/` before being fed to the assembler.
`src/preamble.S` and `src/postamble.S` are added to the start and end of each test's assembly code to provide entry points and other boiler plate.
Compiled executables for the AVR are written as ELF files in `bin/`.


# Test process.

**Note** that testing with QEMU requires a build with `BREAKPOINT_ON_BREAK` set in `target/avr/translate.c`.
Defining this macro makes the `BREAK` instruction behave like a GDB breakpoint (macro still exists as of 2021-07-07).
Without this, the tests don't stop for the GDB script to record register contents.

Each test case runs its target instruction many times with different parameters, executing a `break` instruction after each instance of the target instruction.
The `break` instruction will cause the CPU to pause for debugging, allowing a GDB script to dump the state of important registers.
The GDB script `run-all.gdb` prints the contents of the main registers, status register, program counter, and stack pointer at every `break`, looping until it reaches a symbol called `end` (added by `postamble.S`).

To start avr-qemu for GDB to connect to:
`$QEMU -s -S -M mega2560 -bios bin/$TEST.elf`
(`-display none` can also be useful for builds of QEMU that try to open a graphical window by default)

To start AVaRICE for GDB to connect to a hardware debugger:
`avarice -g -P atmega2560 -j usb -C :1234`

To start GDB with the `run-all.gdb` script (which will connect to either QEMU or AVaRICE), time its execution, and save output for analysis:
`time avr-gdb bin/$TEST.elf -x run-all.gdb > logs/$TEST.log`

Once output logs have been generated for both emulated and real hardware they can be compared with diff, for example:
`diff -y logs/$TEST-QEMU.log logs/$TEST-AVR.log`


# Automated test process.

A package of pre-generated logs (`logs.tar.xz`) is included.
It was generated using an ATMega2560 and an AVR Dragon hardware debugger.

To run an automated test of a new version of QEMU:

- build the test programs using `build.sh`
- unpack the logs to a directory called `logs` (in the same directory as this README file)
- modify the path to QEMU set in `verify.sh` to match your system
- run `verify.sh` from the same directory as this README file

`verify.sh` runs every test program binary found in `bin/` under QEMU and checks the GDB output against a corresponding log file in `logs/`.
It takes tens of minutes to complete.

This script is likely to be fragile!
Testing will fail if, for example, the test programs have changed since the log files were generated.

Please note that our test hardware produced strange behaviour while testing some obscure cases of the `pop` instruction (one of the SO tests).
As a result `verify.sh` will indicate that this test has failed.
You should either manually check the exact nature of the failure, or generate an SO log with a working version of QEMU to compare against (instead of the hardware log).
